<h1 style="text-align: center">Some stuff<br></h1><p class="essay-text">Here is an example on how to format a text entry for highest_stratum.
The parser that builds an html file out of these text files <span class="essay-supplement-a">uses regex.<span class="essay-supplement">it's written in python.</span></span>
You have to use some of my own made-up formatting, so it's kind of <span class="essay-supplement-a">stupid.<span class="essay-supplement">hehe</span></span>
But with this, you can embed <span class="essay-supplement-a">supplemental<span class="essay-supplement">Testing what adding a bunch of text to the far right side of the div looks like, hopefully it doesn't get pushed off the page but we will see lololololololol :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD</span></span> text and <span class="essay-supplement-a">images<img class="essay-supplement" src="https://holedigging.club/fanart/fanart/1577855626612.jpg"></span> as a way to insert parenthetical statements, citations,
or anything else you want.
<br></p><p class="essay-text">To start a new paragraph, just tab. It doesn't even have to be a new line. I won't explain how to write parenthetical text because I'm literally <span class="essay-supplement-a">too lazy.<span class="essay-supplement">will this get put on a new line?</span></span>
test.
<br></p><p class="essay-text">Even quotes have their own styling. You can even use new lines in them, to get them to look nicer:
<span class="essay-quote">'sometimes <br>my <br>genius <br>is <br>almost <br>frightening.'</span><br><br></p><p class="essay-text">I haven't made a way to add a cool attribution to whoever said a quote <span class="essay-supplement-a">yet.<span class="essay-supplement"> but I will soon.</span></span>
anyways. Here is another quote then another picture, to round things out:
<span class="essay-quote">'egg egg, egg.<br>egg egg, egg egg egg.<br>egg. egg egg.'</span><br>and <span class="essay-supplement-a">here<img class="essay-supplement" src="https://holedigging.club/fanart/fanart/1580.jpg"></span> is the picture.<br><br></p><p class="essay-text"><span class="essay-supplement-a">bye bye.<img class="essay-supplement" src="https://holedigging.club/screencaps/screencaps/SS/1582911251936.jpg"></span><br></p></div>
