Test Parse


	Hello, I am test parse.
I am here to test the parsing functions on this page.
	This should be a new paragraph.
This should be in the same paragraph.
((This should be highlighted text)with this text as a supplement).
	Here is another new paragraph.
[(This text should be highlighted with an image as a supplement)writings/testimage.jpg].
""Here is some quoted text.
Quoted text on a new line.
Here is the end of the quoted text->""
	Back to a new paragraph.
That is all, thanks.
