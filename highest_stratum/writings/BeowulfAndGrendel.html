<h1 style="text-align:center">Grendel's Place in Human Consciousness</h1>
<p class="essay-text">
<span style="font-style:italic">Beowulf</span> advocates for a meaningful existence through a societal basis. Beowulf seeks
fame and glory for his acts to be remembered, and he reasserts his loyalty to his clan, country,
and king Hrothgar, further cementing a place in the societal basis.
<div class="essay-supplement-a">Grendel <img class="essay-supplement" src="../images/grendelCover.jpg"> </div>, by John Gardner, is
an exploration of this idea, among others, from the viewpoint of the monster. Specifically, a
viewpoint of a being outside of the societal basis. Grendel struggles with finding a purpose, both
in himself and in the way the world works around him. He has no king or country to devote
allegiance too and his closest living bond is with his mother, who cannot speak, and rarely leaves
the cave. <span style="font-style:italic">Grendel</span> supports the ideas found in <span style="font-style:italic">Beowulf</span> by showing the meaninglessness and
futility of Grendel’s internal search and his glimpses of grandeur and purpose that he finds
externally in interacting with human society. Grendel’s observation of animals and their
mechanical behavior, first encounter with humans and being intrigued by their autonomy,
experience with the Shaper and being taken in by the Shaper’s illusions, and his lecture from the
dragon play into Grendel’s detachment from, and subsequent involvement with, society and to
the same extent, his search for purpose. <span style="font-style:italic">Beowulf</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Grendel</span> both assert that a societal basis is
the most important aspect for achieving purposeful existence.
<br>
</p>
<p class="essay-text">
In <span style="font-style:italic">Beowulf</span>, the basis of purpose is fundamentally built upon the mortality of humans.
Humans have a short lifespan relative to their memory; ideas are passed down through
generations so that some sort of past existence is preserved in the memory of future generations.
Because of this memory, or transgenerational existence, the best way to continue existence is to
commit some great act. Ideally, the great act would be one looked upon favorably by the society;
however, remembrance of great evil can be equally motivating for certain types of people.
Regardless, for entities with a finite lifespan, survival is a large motivator of existence and does
indeed take on the role of the sole purpose for non-societal forms of life. In a society of mortal
humans, the imperative of “survive” takes on the more abstract form of being remembered by
future generations. The dragon in <span style="font-style:italic">Grendel</span> outlines this human behavior by talking about the
impression of human expression on the world. In this case, finitude is the act or expression of the
person and the environment is the society,
<div class="essay-quote">‘Expression is founded on the finite occasion, It is
the activity of finitude impressing itself on its environment’<br> (68, <span style="font-style:italic">Grendel</span>)
</div>
To survive beyond
the finite life, humans have to impress themselves onto the consciousness of their society
<br>
</p>
<p class="essay-text">
<span style="font-style:italic">Beowulf</span> shows common virtues for people of the time to possess to impress themselves
on their society. Beowulf boasts and brags of past deeds he has done and predicts the future
deeds that he will do. Beowulf, in an effort to further inflate his heroic actions, limits himself in
his endeavors to gain more renown,
<div class="essay-quote">
 ‘Unarmed he shall face me<br>
 If face me he dares. And may the Divine Lord<br>
 In His wisdom grant the glory of victory<br>
 To whichever side He sees fit’<br>
(684-687)
</div>
Beowulf is then praised by Hrothgar for his heroic deeds and is firmly planted in the
conscious of the Danish society,
<div class="essay-quote">
‘So now, Beowulf,<br>
I adopt you in my heart as a dear son’<br>
‘You have made yourself immortal<br>
By your glorious action. May the God of Ages<br>
Continue to keep and requite you well’<br>
(945-946,953-955,<span style="font-style:italic">Beowulf</span>)
</div>
Being exalted by the society is a
grant of immortality to Beowulf he will always be remembered, he has fulfilled this societal
imperative of “survive.” He has imprinted his finite actions onto the immortal consciousness of
society. Without this society, there would be no Hrothgar to praise Beowulf or no mead-hall to
save from Grendel, indeed there would be no reason for Beowulf to do heroic acts.
<br>
</p>
<p class="essay-text">
This societal background is not present in <span style="font-style:italic">Grendel</span>; there is seemingly no reason for
Grendel to do anything. Comparing his encounters with humans and organized society, Grendel
notes how mechanical and automated everything seems. Grendel notes the actions of a goat
trying to climb a nearby hill. Even when the animal appears dead, it is hardwired to climb up the
hill, 
<div class="essay-quote">
It is the business of goats to climb<br>
Death shakes his body the way high wind shakes trees. He climbs toward me.<br>
(139,140,<span style="font-style:italic">Grendel</span>)
</div>
A bull attacks Grendel while he is stuck in a
tree. No matter how many times the bull charges, it will always miss him because it is just
following some sort of behavioral pattern, a script that it is seemingly required to follow, 
<div class="essay-quote">
He’d struck too low, and even in my terror I understood that he would always strike too low: he fought
by instinct, blind mechanism ages old<br>
(21) 
</div>
Algorithmic actions of the world around him lead
Grendel to a nihilistic belief, 
<div class="essay-quote">
I understood that, finally and absolutely, I alone exist. All the rest,
I saw, is merely what pushes me, or what I push against, blindly-as blindly as that is not myself
pushes back<br>
(22) 
</div>
Grendel has no complex society to weigh his existence against; there is no
mold-breaker in his world. The society of humanity is the greater entity that gives weight to
Beowulf’s actions; Grendel cannot lend weight to actions in a weightless world. It is because of
this realization that Grendel decides that there is no purpose to existence. Grendel cannot find
purpose internally if 
<div class="essay-quote">
[he] create[s] the universe, blink by blink<br>
(22)
</div>
Through these various
scenarios, Grendel is lost in spite of himself. Trying to find greater purpose in a universe that is
created by the same entity is paradoxical; therefore, no purpose can be found. Grendel can only
find a purpose when presented with proof that he is not the center of the universe.
<br>
</p>
<p class="essay-text">
In Grendel’s first encounter with humans, he immediately marks them as intelligent
creatures. They are beings that arise from a purposeful hierarchy, one much more complex than a
bull or a goat, 
<div class="essay-quote">
Suddenly I knew I was dealing with no dull mechanical bull but with thinking
creatures, pattern makers<br>
(27)
</div>
This first encounter with intelligent life upsets the notion of the
Grendel-centric universe and their future interactions only ensnare Grendel within their mythos
and society. Suddenly, Grendel has something against which to weight himself. He has not yet
found purpose so he searches amongst the culture of man to find out what they believe and strive
to do. Grendel finds his place in complex society when the Shaper describes the struggle of Cain
and Abel and the consequences of that tale, 
<div class="essay-quote">
He told of an ancient feud between two brothers
which split all the world between darkness and light. And I, Grendel, was the dark side<br>
(51)
</div>
Although Grendel has his doubts about this dichotomy of man and monster, its primary reason
was to place him into the context of man.
<br>
</p>
<p class="essay-text">
Grendel’s visit with the dragon provides clarity for his place among humans. While the
dragon is needlessly verbose and instills a sense of nihilism in Grendel, his lecture can be
interpreted in different ways. The dragon states that it is Grendel’s place to interact with the
humans, being Cain to their Abel; he must fulfill some sort of relationship with them. Grendel’s
place in human society is to be the monster, he is the force in the world against which all humans
measure their virtue and worth, 
<div class="essay-quote">
‘You are, so to speak, the brute existent by which they learn to
define themselves’<br>
(73)
</div>
Indeed, in <span style="font-style:italic">Beowulf</span>, the titular hero is doing exactly that. Beowulf
proves himself against the monster and earns the admiration of his compatriots. However,
Grendel’s existence in the society as a monster is finite, much like a human life. If Grendel
chooses not to engage in this adversarial idea, then another force will replace him, 
<div class="essay-quote">
‘If you
withdraw, you’ll instantly be replaced. Brute existents, you know, are a dime a dozen’<br>
(73)
</div>
Thus, Grendel will be failing the “survival” imperative, he will become obsolete and his life will
be just as purposeless as before. In order to survive with purpose, Grendel has no meaningful
choice but to engage with humans. He has to hold a permanent place in their psyche; in the same 
way, Beowulf must cement himself as a great hero. While Grendel may be an unwilling
participant in the struggle of humanity, this inevitability drives him. Humans shape their own
past and history and Grendel is drawn into their mythos simply because he must be. Humanity
must always have a counter; as surely as iron sharpens iron, Grendel finds a purpose in human
society.
<br>
</p>
<p class="essay-text">
<span style="font-style:italic">Beowulf</span> is planted in the external: the deeds of a hero and legacy that he leaves behind,
not necessarily his thoughts or inner convictions. However, the ideas that build societies and
instill purpose in individuals can be gleaned from it. Beowulf finds purpose in imprinting his
deeds and character on history; his many boasts prove this important to him. <span style="font-style:italic">Grendel</span> is more
abstract. Grendel lives outside the sphere of humans for a long while before crossing paths with
them. He sees the ways of the world, at least he thinks he does, and interprets it to be some
mechanical pattern. He grows bored of being the center. Even when he first encounters humans,
Grendel exists away from them. He thinks it would be best to leave them alone. Grendel
succeeds in his isolation until he notices the Shaper weaving him into man’s history. The Shaper
thrusts Grendel into the world of man and he can no longer make a passive decision. The dragon
reveals Grendel’s purpose to him; he exists as the force of nature, which works against man to
improve them. If Grendel refuses, he disappears only to be replaced by some other brutish force.
Only in accepting his role will Grendel find solace. For the same reason as Beowulf, Grendel
must find purpose by imprinting himself on human society. Grendel must become the monster
that everyone remembers. To survive and carry on is the purpose of all life; to become immortal,
one must be canonized into the memory of human society. Only human society, the entity with
the ability to shape the pattern of past and present, can provide this ultimate survival.
