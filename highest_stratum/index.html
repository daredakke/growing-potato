<h1>Welcome to the (tall) zone</h1>
<pre> 
"If only we didn't have to eat to live," 
		
"I would hardly... call that living"

	- Titus and Julius (v1,c5,p3)
	
Julius' philosophy on life and ontology call to mind Alexander Schmemann's discourse on the mysticism of everyday life.

Mankind lives to eat.
