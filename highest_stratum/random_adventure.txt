Random Adventure

	Went up to a local [(mountain yesterday with my dad and his friend, who are both hardcore photographers,) https://cool.holedigging.club/highest_stratum/images/darkf_random_adventure/1.jpeg]
giving me a few hours to do whatever in this basin of a frozen lake. The car ride was agonizing, but fortunately my mood flipped as soon as we were on location.

((my pixel lost the will to charge last month.)so these awful iphone shots are all I have.)
	Trekking the left side of the basin, [(think this one was on the descent.)https://cool.holedigging.club/highest_stratum/images/darkf_random_adventure/3.jpeg]
Sliding down was incredibly fun with music.
	[(This is about as far as I got on the first walk up the left side,)https://cool.holedigging.club/highest_stratum/images/darkf_random_adventure/4.jpeg]
could definitely have gone higher but was honestly nervous seeing the tracks everywhere. Next time I'll bring poles and make the top.
	Found a bunch of [(animal tracks)https://cool.holedigging.club/highest_stratum/images/darkf_random_adventure/5.jpeg] 
on the first walk up the left side, for some reason didn't take a picture of the large ones at the top. Found this one on a later run and someone who came down from the mountain claimed there were cougar tracks up there, so that might be what this one is.
[(These might just be dog lol)https://cool.holedigging.club/highest_stratum/images/darkf_random_adventure/6.jpeg]

	[(pano from the right side peak,)https://cool.holedigging.club/highest_stratum/images/darkf_random_adventure/8.jpeg] which was significantly more steep than left, but let me refine the technique a little bit before attempting the center.

	These pics really don't do justice to the [(steepness of the terrain,)https://cool.holedigging.club/highest_stratum/images/darkf_random_adventure/12.jpeg] 
I would estimate the center hill to have been about 70°-75° max, and of course I forgot to take the crucial slant picture of that going up.

	[(Rainier)https://cool.holedigging.club/highest_stratum/images/darkf_random_adventure/17.jpeg] 
from a slightly lower hill on the [(left side)https://cool.holedigging.club/highest_stratum/images/darkf_random_adventure/19.jpeg] of the
[(basin.)https://cool.holedigging.club/highest_stratum/images/darkf_random_adventure/20.jpeg]
	[(Here I slid on my ass into this treewell,)https://cool.holedigging.club/highest_stratum/images/darkf_random_adventure/21.jpeg] 
somehow sustaining no damage and just falling out of it. The 
[(aftermath)https://cool.holedigging.club/highest_stratum/images/darkf_random_adventure/24.jpeg] doesn't really look it, but the sliding brought a ton of snow, like a mini-avalanche with it.
	angle makes it look 
[(flat)https://cool.holedigging.club/highest_stratum/images/darkf_random_adventure/22.jpeg], this was not high-effort 
[(photography)https://cool.holedigging.club/highest_stratum/images/darkf_random_adventure/23.jpeg] from me.
	[(This)https://cool.holedigging.club/highest_stratum/images/darkf_random_adventure/25.jpeg] is the center hill from about the middle (height-wise) of the basin. Climbing it was 
[(more or less walking)https://cool.holedigging.club/highest_stratum/images/darkf_random_adventure/27.jpeg] until it became 
[(exceptionally steep,)https://cool.holedigging.club/highest_stratum/images/darkf_random_adventure/26.jpeg] and then the technique was a mix of kicking into the hill with the cleats and stabbing it with hands to drag myself up or to the side. Mentally I refer to it as 'spider climbing' although I'm sure there's a real name for it.
	[(Hole leading to the lake.)https://cool.holedigging.club/highest_stratum/images/darkf_random_adventure/28.jpeg] For some reason this was completely 
[(uninteresting to the photographers,)https://cool.holedigging.club/highest_stratum/images/darkf_random_adventure/29.jpeg] although I found it cool. There were lots of mini ones of these, sometimes leading to rocks or just a hole higher up. I think climbers die in crevasses sometimes.
They really stood here the whole time, 
[(barely talking and with no music.)https://cool.holedigging.club/highest_stratum/images/darkf_random_adventure/30.jpeg] I'd be so bored but they're clearly invested in the process.
