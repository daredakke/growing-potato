Some stuff

	Here is an example on how to format a text entry for highest_stratum.
The parser that builds an html file out of these text files ((uses regex.)it's written in python.)
You have to use some of my own made-up formatting, so it's kind of ((stupid.)hehe)
But with this, you can embed ((supplemental)Testing what adding a bunch of text to the far right side of the div looks like, hopefully it doesn't get pushed off the page but we will see lololololololol :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD) text and [(images)https://holedigging.club/fanart/fanart/1577855626612.jpg] as a way to insert parenthetical statements, citations,
or anything else you want.
	To start a new paragraph, just tab. It doesn't even have to be a new line. I won't explain how to write parenthetical text because I'm literally ((too lazy.)will this get put on a new line?)

	Even quotes have their own styling. You can even use new lines in them, to get them to look nicer:
""sometimes 
my 
genius 
is 
almost

	I haven't made a way to add a cool attribution to whoever said a quote ((yet.) but I will soon.)
anyways. Here is another quote then another picture, to round things out:
""egg egg, egg.
egg egg, egg egg egg.
egg. egg egg.""
and [(here)https://holedigging.club/fanart/fanart/1580.jpg] is the picture.
